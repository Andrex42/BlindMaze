# 🎧 The Blind Labyrinth: Audio-Augmented Navigation

> A navigation experiment in 3D environments based entirely on procedural audio synthesis and game physics.

## 📖 Project Description

**The Blind Labyrinth** is a Unity project that explores the role of audio as an active Navigational Aid.

Unlike traditional video games, this project adopts a **"Zero-Asset"** philosophy: no pre-recorded audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`) are used. The entire soundscape—from player footsteps and ambience to guidance signals—is generated in real-time by the CPU using DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithms.

The goal is to demonstrate how sound synthesis, dynamically integrated with physics Raycasting, can guide the player towards non-visible (occluded) objectives and provide precise feedback on the spatial geometry.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔊 1. Pure Procedural Audio (Sample-Free)
All sounds are mathematically synthesized via `OnAudioFilterRead`:
* **Sonar Beacon:** Additive synthesis using sine waves. The pulsation frequency (LFO) is directly controlled by the Euclidean distance between the Player and the Goal.
* **Footsteps:** Subtractive synthesis. White Noise shaped by short ADSR envelopes and Low-Pass Filters, featuring stochastic pitch variation to eliminate repetition.
* **Ambience:** Generation of Brownian Noise (integrated White Noise) to create a low-frequency "rumble" that simulates an underground environment.
* **Victory Event:** Procedural generation of an ascending arpeggio with specific harmonics (Perfect Fifth/Octave) and dynamic mixing (immediate muting of other sources).

### 🧱 2. Physics & Spatial Audio
* **Sonar Navigation:** The audio tempo acts as a guide (Slow = Far, Fast = Near).
* **Dynamic Occlusion:** A Raycasting system traces the line of sight between the Source and the Listener. If a wall interrupts the ray, a Low Pass Filter is applied in real-time, simulating sound diffraction and obstacle absorption.
* **3D Spatial Blend:** Full binaural localization allowing the player to identify the source direction.

### 🧩 3. Procedural Level Generation
* Implementation of the **Recursive Backtracker** algorithm to generate perfect mazes (no loops) that are unique on every run.
* Automatic "safe placement" of the Player and Goal at opposite ends of the map to ensure playability.

## 🛠️ Scripts & Architecture

The core components of the project are:

* **`ProceduralBeacon.cs`:** Manages the sine oscillator and proximity logic (Distance → LFO Speed).
* **`ProceduralFootsteps.cs`:** Detects `CharacterController` movement and triggers footstep synthesis.
* **`OcclusionHandler.cs`:** Handles Raycasts and modulates the audio filter's Cutoff Frequency.
* **`MazeGenerator.cs`:** Generates the grid, builds meshes (Walls/Ceiling), and handles safe player spawning (physics fix).
* **`WinHandler.cs`:** Manages the victory trigger, pauses gameplay, and synthesizes the final audio reward.

## 🎮 Controls

| Action | Input |

| **Move** | `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` |
| **Look around** | `Mouse` |
| **Objective** | Follow the pulsing sound (Beacon) to find the glowing exit. |

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. **Open the project** with Unity Hub (*Recommended version: 2021.3 or higher*).
3. **Open the `MainScene`** located in the `Scenes` folder.
4. **Press Play.**

## 🐛 Technical Notes / Troubleshooting

* **CPU Cost:** Since audio is generated via software, CPU usage is slightly higher compared to playing static samples. However, RAM and Disk I/O impact is virtually zero.
* **Respawn Physics:** The generator includes a Safe Start system that momentarily disables the `CharacterController` during respawn to prevent physics pass-through bugs (falling through the floor).
